## Project Overview

This is the completed project for identifying and classifying dog breeds using
a Convolution Neural Network (CNN). Submitted as a capstone project for the Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree.

The main code pipeline is located in `dog_app.ipynb` and the project report is in `final_report.pdf`.

A few extra testing images are located in `test_images`.

The project uses Python 3.5 with the following libraries:
* OpenCV
* Matplotlib
* PyTorch
* Torchvision

The main datasets for this project can be downloaded from here:
* Dogs: https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip
* Humans: http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/lfw.tgz

The trained models are located here and should be downloaded and saved to the
project's root directory:
